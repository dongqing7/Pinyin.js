# Pīnyīn.js

With this plugin, you can make any text field on your website understand numeric Pin1yin1 and instantly convert it to proper Pīnyīn with tone marks.

You just type a Pīnyīn syllable followed by a tone number (1, 2, 3 or 4). The script will take the needed vowel and replace it with its accented version.
